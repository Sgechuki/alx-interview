# 0x04. UTF-8 Validation
## Concepts Needed:
Bitwise Operations in Python:

Understanding how to manipulate bits in Python, including operations like AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), shifts (<<, >>).
Python Bitwise Operators

Familiarity with the UTF-8 encoding rules, including how characters are encoded into one or more bytes.
Understanding the patterns that represent a valid UTF-8 encoded character.
Data Representation:

How to represent and work with data at the byte level.
Handling the least significant bits (LSB) of integers to simulate byte data.
List Manipulation in Python:

Iterating through lists, accessing list elements, and understanding list comprehensions.

Boolean Logic:

Applying logical operations to make decisions within the program.
